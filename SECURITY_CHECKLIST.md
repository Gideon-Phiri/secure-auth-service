# Security Hardening Checklist

## âœ… COMPLETED FIXES

### Container Security
- âœ… Changed from root user to `vscode` user  
- âœ… Added proper user creation in Dockerfile
- âœ… Fixed file permissions

### Database Security  
- âœ… Changed default PostgreSQL credentials
- âœ… Removed PostgreSQL port exposure from host
- âœ… Added environment variable support for passwords

### Application Security
- âœ… Fixed incomplete authentication endpoints
- âœ… Implemented missing CRUD operations
- âœ… Added security middleware (CORS, TrustedHost)
- âœ… Updated environment configuration

### Port Security
- âœ… Removed PostgreSQL port (5432) from forwarded ports
- âœ… Only expose necessary application port (8000)

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL NEXT STEPS (YOU MUST DO)

### 1. Generate Secure Credentials
```bash
# Generate a secure SECRET_KEY (run this command):
python -c "import secrets; print(f'SECRET_KEY={secrets.token_urlsafe(32)}')"

# Generate secure database password:
python -c "import secrets; print(f'DB_PASSWORD={secrets.token_urlsafe(16)}')"
```

### 2. Create Production .env File
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update ALL values:
- Replace `CHANGE_THIS_SECURE_PASSWORD` with actual secure password
- Replace `CHANGE_THIS_TO_A_VERY_LONG_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY` with generated key

### 3. Database Security
- Change PostgreSQL password from default
- Consider using managed database service in production
- Enable SSL connections in production

## ðŸ”’ ADDITIONAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] Add account lockout after failed attempts  
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Implement proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Add request ID tracking

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Add password complexity requirements
- [ ] Implement refresh token rotation
- [ ] Add email verification for registration
- [ ] Set up proper HTTPS in production
- [ ] Add security headers middleware

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Use secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- [ ] Set up proper firewall rules
- [ ] Enable database encryption at rest
- [ ] Implement proper backup strategies
- [ ] Add health checks and monitoring
- [ ] Set up log aggregation (ELK stack, etc.)

## ðŸŽ¯ VS Code Server Security

The VS Code Dev Container server is generally secure because:
- Uses authentication tokens
- Binds to localhost by default  
- Uses encrypted communication
- Automatically manages ports

However, ensure:
- Keep VS Code updated
- Don't expose dev container ports publicly
- Use strong host machine security

## ðŸš« NEVER DO IN PRODUCTION

- Never use default passwords
- Never expose database ports publicly
- Never run containers as root
- Never commit .env files to git
- Never disable HTTPS in production
- Never ignore security updates
